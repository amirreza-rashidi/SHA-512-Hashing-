Â SHA-512 Hashing in C++



A minimal, header-only C++ implementation of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function.

No external dependenciesâ€”just the standard library. Ideal for learning how SHA-512 works end-to-end.



âœ¨ Features



Pure C++ (uses only <vector>, <string>, <iostream>, etc.). 



Complete SHA-512 message padding, 1024-bit block processing, and 80-round compression with standard constants K. 



Simple CLI: enter any text and get its SHA-512 digest in hex.
